# Cleaned 1-D Photochemistry Submodule 

This git repository is initialised with the original model code as recieved from the 
OU, and is altered to provide tracer support for organic chemistry routines involving
CH4 and C2H6. 

## Complaints

Git is arguably the worst software I've ever encountered. This is not the README that
all logical thought processes dictate should be here, but git doesn't work logically,
it operates in some indecipherable way that's either mentally 1000's of years more
advanced than current human thought, or 10000's of years backwards in time in the days
of cavemen. This might be the 100th attempt I've made at creating a flowing TLM branch.
This software is garbage to work with. It's added skip-fulls of stress onto my PhD, 
and the people who make it should truly consider making it at least semi-operatable for
people who haven't got Masters degrees in computing science. Here, I will attempt to
record the building of the TLM. It won't work; it will become messy, convoluted, 
non-navigatable, and at this point all I can see is: I don't frankly care anymore. Thank
you github, for showing me how inept I truly am at the should-be-easy process of version
control. I'm earnestly trying my best here.
